Please do not update or modify the external libraries in this folder as doing so may cause undesired side effects.
Many of our libraries are customized in some way, and updating them to their official versions would cause our modifications to be lost.
(Which is why we are not using NuGet)
Updates may also contain breaking changes which we need to review before updating any external libraries.
